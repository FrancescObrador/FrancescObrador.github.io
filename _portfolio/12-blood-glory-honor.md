Last year university degree project. [Blood, Glory & Honor][bgh] is a gritty, Medieval Turn-Based Strategy game with pixel graphics where the position and facing of units influence their chances of victory. Inspired by games such as Advance Wars and Wargroove, BG&H uses a hex grid with a flanking system to revolutionize the genre.
