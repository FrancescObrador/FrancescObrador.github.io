Remake of a Retro game as a university project. The goal of the project was to learn the Scrum workflow. 

I managed the development process planning and reviewing the 2-week sprints. Moreover I learned the JS Phaser framework from scratch.

- 3-members group.
- 2-month development.
- Scrum master and gameplay programmer.
- Scrum planning graded as excellent.
