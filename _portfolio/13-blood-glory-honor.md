Last year university degree project. [Blood, Glory & Honor][bgh] is a gritty, Medieval Turn-Based Strategy game. 

With pixel graphics where the position and facing of units influence their chances of victory. Inspired by games such as Advance Wars and Wargroove, BG&H uses a hex grid with a flanking system to revolutionize the genre.

We formed a multidisciplinary team where I worked closely with artists (3D and 2D artists, a musician and a writer). My role was to plan, manage and develop the project as a Vertical Slice with my university mates.

## Responsabilities
- Colaborate on define the core game mechanics
- Planning and estimating tasks
- Dialogue system & hints system development
- Design, write and implement the characters' dialogues
