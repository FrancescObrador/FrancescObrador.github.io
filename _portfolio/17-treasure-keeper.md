In this pixelart, simple-click videogame, you will have to fight against the constant coming of orcs, goblins and ogre hordes who want to take away your treasure chest.

Enemies come from all directions, but you have the most powerful weapon to defeat them: your fingers! To shoot them repetaedly and destroy them, you just have to click on your mobile screen many times. If they reach the chest , they will take it away little by little. Do not let your treasure dissapear from your screen or they will have won!
